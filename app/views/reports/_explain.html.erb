<p>This chart presents two lines: the blue line initially indicates the initial investment amount, which gradually decreases over time until it reaches zero. This represents the return on investment (ROI) as your initial investment pays off. The second line illustrates the annual electricity bill payments, showing the ongoing expenses incurred. By comparing these lines, you can track how your investment payoff correlates with your electricity costs.
